# Fantasy Basketball Lineup Optimizer
This project aims to assist fantasy basketball enthusiasts in constructing the most competitive lineups for their weekly matchups. In the world of fantasy basketball, enthusiasts draft 13 players at the season's onset and face a different opponent every week. Here's a breakdown of how I designed this platform:

Data Collection
To craft accurate predictions for player performances, data was sourced from:

• Uploaded databases
• APIs
• Web scraping
For the 2022 season as an example, while over 800 players stepped onto the court, filtering was applied to focus on those with three or more seasons of experience, narrowing the set to 290 players. Statistics for these players were extracted from sources such as basketballmonster.com and basketballreference.com.

Modeling Approach
Leveraging the power of deep learning, I employed LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory networks), a breakthrough variant of recurrent neural networks, to discern patterns and project sequential data. LSTM models, courtesy of TensorFlow, were designed for six categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers. These models use historical stats to predict upcoming performances, which in turn estimate their fantasy scores.

Reliability and Confidence
To gauge prediction trustworthiness, a confidence interval was integrated. Adopting a normal distribution assumption across league player stats, I used z-scores for a tail test, determining a 90% confidence interval's bounds. The ultimate lineup quality score combines the predicted fantasy score with this reliability metric, granting users insight into their team's strength on a rolling basis.

User Experience
The fantasy basketball lineup website I developed offers:

• Lineup creation using a user's choice of 13 players, generating ten lineup variants to maximize potential scores.
• Analysis on the most promising lineup.
• Player replacement within an existing lineup, powered by the same forecasting model.
• A user-friendly front-end experience, incorporating clear labeling, easy navigation, drop-downs for existing player selections, and clear visuals.
While the database houses data for over 290 NBA players, there might be active players not listed. Thus, the platform uses web scraping to fetch stats for such players upon user requests.

Future Improvements
Areas identified for potential enhancements include:

User customization for statistical category weightings.
Detailed player profiles providing context such as injury histories or matchup insights.
Interactive features like live updates or player comparisons to elevate user engagement.
Conclusion
This project, with its foundation in deep learning, aspires to revolutionize fantasy NBA lineup decision-making. By offering deep insights and comprehensive analysis, it seeks to empower fantasy basketball aficionados in their pursuit of league dominance.
