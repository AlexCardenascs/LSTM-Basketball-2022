# Fantasy Basketball Lineup Optimizer
This project aims to assist fantasy basketball enthusiasts in constructing the most competitive lineups for their weekly matchups. In the world of fantasy basketball, enthusiasts draft 13 players at the season's onset and face a different opponent every week. Here's a breakdown of how I designed this platform:

### Data Collection
To craft accurate predictions for player performances, data was sourced from:

* Uploaded databases
* APIs
* Web scraping

For the 2022 season as an example, while over 800 players stepped onto the court, filtering was applied to focus on those with three or more seasons of experience, narrowing the set to 290 players. Statistics for these players were extracted from sources such as basketballmonster.com and basketballreference.com.

### Modeling Approach
Leveraging the power of deep learning, I employed LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory networks), a breakthrough variant of recurrent neural networks, to discern patterns and project sequential data. LSTM models, courtesy of TensorFlow, were designed for six categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers. These models use historical stats to predict upcoming performances, which in turn estimate their fantasy scores.

### Reliability and Confidence
To gauge prediction trustworthiness, a confidence interval was integrated. Adopting a normal distribution assumption across league player stats, I used z-scores for a tail test, determining a 90% confidence interval's bounds. The ultimate lineup quality score combines the predicted fantasy score with this reliability metric, granting users insight into their team's strength on a rolling basis.

### User Experience
The fantasy basketball lineup website I developed offers:

* Lineup creation using a user's choice of 13 players, generating ten lineup variants to maximize potential scores.
* Analysis on the most promising lineup.
* Player replacement within an existing lineup, powered by the same forecasting model.
* A user-friendly front-end experience, incorporating clear labeling, easy navigation, drop-downs for existing player selections, and clear visuals.

While the database houses data for over 290 NBA players, there might be active players not listed. Thus, the platform uses web scraping to fetch stats for such players upon user requests.

### Future Improvements
Areas identified for potential enhancements include:

* User customization for statistical category weightings.
* Detailed player profiles providing context such as injury histories or matchup insights.
* Interactive features like live updates or player comparisons to elevate user engagement.
  
### Conclusion
This project, with its foundation in deep learning, aspires to revolutionize fantasy NBA lineup decision-making. By offering deep insights and comprehensive analysis, it seeks to empower fantasy basketball aficionados in their pursuit of league dominance.

# Project Format: Jupyter Notebook
This entire project has been developed and documented within a Jupyter Notebook, adopting the .ipynb file format. Jupyter Notebook offers an interactive computing environment, making it ideal for developing and presenting data science projects like this one.






## Installation and Setup

To ensure the smooth execution of this Jupyter Notebook and its associated functions, you'll need to install several Python packages and utilities. Below is a breakdown of the necessary installations and their intended use:

- **Database Utilities**: 
  - `mysqlclient`: Enables Python to access and interact with MySQL databases.
  - `sqlalchemy`: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
  - `sql_magic`: An extension to facilitate SQL integration within Jupyter notebooks.

- **Web Scraping**:
  - `selenium`: Used for automating web browsers, aiding in web scraping tasks.

- **Data Processing and Machine Learning**:
  - `numpy` and `pandas`: Handle numerical computations and data manipulation respectively.
  - `tensorflow`: Enables deep learning functionalities.
  - `sklearn`: Provides machine learning algorithms.
  - `pydot` and `graphviz`: Used for creating, rendering, and displaying graph structures using Python.
  - `unidecode`: Transforms Unicode text into its closest ASCII representation.

- **Flask Deployment & Tunneling**:
  - `flask-ngrok`: Facilitates the deployment of Flask apps from Jupyter notebooks via ngrok tunnels.
  - `Jinja2`: A templating engine for Python, commonly used with Flask.
  - `pyngrok`: Allows you to create and manage ngrok sessions from Python.

**Important Note**: If you're using `ngrok` for tunneling, ensure you have an authentication token. The provided token in the initial setup (`ngrok authtoken`) is a placeholder and you might need to replace it with your own.

Lastly, the commands `mkdir static` and `mkdir templates` are used to create directories essential for a Flask web application structure.

# Code Efficiency and Project Scope

While this Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the complete process and steps undertaken to achieve the desired functionality, it's worth noting that some aspects of the code may not be optimized for large-scale, production-level deployment. Running this application at scale and making it available to a vast audience would likely necessitate different coding strategies, architecture decisions, and perhaps even infrastructure considerations.

Several factors contribute to this:

1. **Web Scraping**: This method of data extraction can be resource-intensive and potentially violate terms of service. In a commercial setting, API access or direct data partnerships would be more sustainable and efficient.

2. **Deep Learning Models**: While LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models provide considerable accuracy in many scenarios, they can be computationally expensive. Deploying these models for a large number of users in real-time would require robust infrastructure and potential model optimizations.

3. **Data Processing**: Some operations, especially those on larger datasets, could be further optimized using more efficient algorithms or distributed computing techniques.

4. **Database Operations**: For larger-scale applications, ensuring database scalability, fast read-write operations, and efficient data retrieval mechanisms would be crucial.

5. **Web Deployment**: Leveraging Flask and ngrok is a convenient way to showcase a prototype or a small-scale project. However, for a production-level application, more robust web servers and deployment strategies would be needed.

It's essential to understand that the primary aim of this project and the associated repository is to display the programming journey and capture every step in that process. While it encapsulates the end-to-end development, it is primarily an illustrative tool rather than a finalized product.
